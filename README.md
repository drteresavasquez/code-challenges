1. In the README file that you create with your repo, write out explanations of the following concepts as if you are explaining it to a 12 year old. Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.
		

		* Variables
		* Strings
		* Functions (arguments, `return`)
		* `if` statements
		* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
		* Variables - Variables are essentially placeholders we use to represent or contain a value. 
		* Strings - Strings are a way of grouping text and characters to have them represent as one value. So for example you can put a number in a string and it won't return as a value of a number. Also you could include the words true and false and they won't return as boolean values. 
		* Functions (arguments, `return`) - Functions are the code we use in Javascript to perform a task like addition or subtraction, and more complex things. 
		- Arguments are similar to variables. The arguments are just essentially the variables we are passing into our function. The things we want our function to perform the task on. 
		- the `return` portion of a function is the section that performs the code within the function and gives back the value. So if a function was written to perform addition. Return would give us the sum.
		* `if` statements - If statements are called conditionals. So like "If today is Monday, that means I have class. In terms of coding I could write code that would check if the today is in fact monday, and then it could print out text reminding me to go to class. 
		* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) - So in the above if statment, checking if today is monday is me checking for a boolean value. If today is Monday, than it would result in the boolean value of "true", but if it's any other day, than it would return a boolean value of "false". So I could code a statment that depending on the boolean value one of two messages would be displayed.
