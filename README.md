# Instructions

1. In the README file that you create with your repo, write out explanations of the following concepts as if you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables
	* Strings
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
	* `if` statements
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)

2. Complete the JS code in [Week3.js](Week3-JS-I.js)

3. Push up your code to your repo and submit your Assignment Card in ClassTracker

## Definitions
---
- *Variables*: A variable is a placeholder that can hold many different values.
- *Strings*: A string is a data type that is enclosed by quotation marks or back ticks. Typically, a string is formed by words/letters but it can include numbers as well.
- *Functions*: A function is a reusable piece of code that takes in a value known as an argument, changes that argument in some way, and then returns that changed value.
- *if Statements*: An if statement is used to check whether something is true or false (Boolean value) and then direct a function on what step to take according to the result.
- *Boolean values*: A Boolean value is either true or false. Reducing something to a Boolean value is useful for using logic to solve problems.
