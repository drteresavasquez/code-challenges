## Instructions

1. In the README file that you create with your repo, write out explanations of the following concepts as if you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables
	* Strings
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
	* `if` statements
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)

2. Complete the JS code in [Week3.js](Week3-JS-I.js)

3. Push up your code to your repo and submit your Assignment Card in ClassTracker



#Foundations!!

#####Variables

Variables are words that hold values to use throughout our code. In es6 we define these with let and const. let means it can be changes and const means the value remains constant throughout!

#####Strings

Strings are values in our code surrounded by single or double quotation marks. They are what we use to define words but a number can aslo be a string

#####Functions

Functions are used throughout our code to do a specific job. We use them so we dont have to constantly rewrite the same code asking the computer to do a specific task. Arguments are any value that we are passing into the function. we want the function to work regarless of what the value of the argument is. When we say return at the end of the function we want it to actually return the value and stop the function.

#####If statements
We use if statements as conditonal logic. It basically means If said statement is true then execute the following code. we usually follow it with an else statement to say if the first statement isnt true then move to the next piece of code and execute it


#####Boolean
We use boolean values to simply say if a condition is true or false. say if a value is less than another value then execute true, if its not then execute as false
