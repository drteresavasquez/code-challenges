	* Strings
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
	* `if` statements
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)

2. Complete the JS code in [Week3.js](Week3-JS-I.js)

3. Push up your code to your repo and submit your Assignment Card in ClassTracker


Variables are a representation of usable data.

A string is text.

A function is a tool to perform tasks and calculations. A return statement stops the function and returns a value back to where it was called from.

If statements only perform an action if a certain criteria is met.

Booleans state the truth values of logic.
