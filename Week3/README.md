## Instructions

1. In the README file that you create with your repo, write out explanations of the following concepts as if you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables: a variable is a representation of its assigned value. Think of a dollar bill--- it's a variable (`var`), its name is dollar bill (`var = dollarBill`), and its value is 1 (`const dollarBill = 1`). - SD
	* Strings: a type of value written in quotes (""), or a "string" of data. An example: (`let dollarBill = "one"`) where "one" is the string. - SD
	* Functions (arguments, `return`): functions make up the majority of javascript; you can write entire pages of code in functions. They are multiple statements, written together, to perform tasks (such as manipulating data). When the function "runs," or is initialized, it triggers the written statements within the function. Functions can refer to, or call, other functions. 
	* `if` statements
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)

2. Complete the JS code in [Week3.js](Week3-JS-I.js)

3. Push up your code to your repo and submit your Assignment Card in ClassTracker
