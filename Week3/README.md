## Instructions

1. In the README file that you create with your repo, write out explanations of the following concepts as if you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables: Variables are boxes that you put code into. If you want to contain some code, you put it into a variable.
	* Strings: Strings are the parts of code where you want a user to see exactly what you type in. 
	* Functions (arguments, `return`): Functions are the part of code where you make something happen when you run them. They sometimes take in arguments that lets them know how to run the code. They'll return something, which is the result of the code plus the argument(s).
	* `if` statements: If statements are code that ask if something is true, and then do something if it is true, and will do another thing if it's false or if another thing is true.
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`): Boolean values return one of two values, true or false, depending on the statement that comes before them.

2. Complete the JS code in [Week3.js](Week3-JS-I.js)

3. Push up your code to your repo and submit your Assignment Card in ClassTracker
