## Instructions

1. In the README file that you create with your repo, write out explanations of the following concepts as if you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables: A variable is a letter that can be used a placeholder for any value. Variables are usually represented as lower case letters that can be used as a box to contain code that you will use.
	* Strings: Strings series of characters that can be used to relay a message. Strings can be any characters used inside of double quotations("") or single quotations('').
	* Functions (arguments, `return`): Functions are procedures to perform tasks. They can also calculate values.
	* `if` statements: If statements execute blocks of code if the statement is true. It stops if/when the statement becomes false.
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`): Boolean values are either true or false and help to evalute if a statement is true or false and based of that evaluation some action may occur.

2. Complete the JS code in [Week3.js](Week3-JS-I.js)

3. Push up your code to your repo and submit your Assignment Card in ClassTracker
